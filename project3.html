          Rani Laxmibai also called the Rani of Jhansi was a pivotal figure in
          the Indian Revolt of 1857. She is also regarded as one of the greatest
          freedom fighters in India. Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November
          1828 in the town of Varanasi. She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was
          nicknamed Manu.Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother was
          Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai); they hailed from modern-day
          Maharashtra. At four years old her mother passed away. Her father was
          the Commander of War under Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithorr District. She
          was educated at home, able to read and write, and was more independent
          in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included
          shooting, horsemanship, and fencing which was in contrast to the
          cultural expectations for women in Indian society at the time.

          At the age of 14, she was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar
          Rao in 1842. After her marriage, she was called Laxmibai. Rani Lakshmi
          Bai's son Damodar Rao was born in 1851. But he died after four months.
          Gangadhar Rao died in 1853. Before he died, he had adopted his
          cousin's son Anand Rao, who was renamed, Damodar Rao.After the death
          of the Maharaja the British East India Company, under Governor-General
          Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's
          claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When
          she was informed of this she cried out "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi"
          (I shall not surrender my Jhansi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was
          given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace
          and the fort.

          In 1857, the Indian Rebellion, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, erupted
          against the British rule. Rani Lakshmibai joined the uprising and
          became a prominent leader.The most notable event in Lakshmibai's
          military campaign was the Siege of Jhansi in 1858. British forces, led
          by Sir Hugh Rose, besieged the city. Lakshmibai defended Jhansi
          fiercely, but the city eventually fell after several days of intense
          fighting.Rani Lakshmibai fought bravely until the end. She died in
          battle in Gwalior on June 17, 1858, while trying to defend her
          territory against the British forces.
